To reduce dependency pain:
- Remember most R package installation failures are caused by the absence of system libraries installed by apt-get
- To monitor progress easily, use docker build --no-cache -t my_r . | tee docker.log | grep "DONE\|ERROR"
- Fix any errors immediately on sight. Explicitly install failing pacjkages at the top of the script, for fast feedback
